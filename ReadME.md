# AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam (SAA-C03) Exam Notes

## Context:
- [I am an aspiring DevOps Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashgadwal7/) who has primarily worked as a SQL Server Database Administrator and a Freelancer in the DevOps space. I have gotten my hands dirty in the cloud domain due to my traditional support background in the past. :) 
-  I've enjoyed working in the CI/CD + DevOps space more than the traditional support role and the related processes. Be it 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐬, I'm all game for that! 
- I have  worked on PoCs (proof of concepts) across Microsoft Azure and AWS.
- With my work now gravitating towards AWS more recently, I want to prepare myself and tick off AWS solutions architect associate exam from my list of to-dos.

## Acknowledgements
- I have used https://learn.cantrill.io/ as my primary resource for learning, based on recommendation of a lot of people out on the Interwebz, especially Reddit. I would reccomend it highly too now, as Adrian (the author) not only covers the exam, but dives deep into the what's, why's and how's of AWS, which I love.
